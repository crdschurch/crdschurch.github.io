	  			<h1>About</h1>
				<p>The Crossroads Lab is an effort to open our work and the technologies we're implementing. We are the staff and volunteers contributing to projects. We build and implement software needed to run the <a href="http://crossroads.net">crossroads</a> church organization.</p>
				<p>We will strive to open everything from project management to code. This site will also be used as a prototyping ground so expect to see a lot of half built functionality. Since we wish to be as open as possible, we'll push our work live to this site as often as possible this means you see things as they progress.</p>
				<p>We hope this site and it's content is useful for other churches or organizations alike.</p>
